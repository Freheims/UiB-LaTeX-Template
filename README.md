Template based on [a template from NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no/wiki/display/ross/LaTeX+Template+for+Project+and+Master+Theses) and [an old template for UiB](https://github.com/ogrim/uib-latex)

If you are using this template in Overleaf and has issues with Minted try to move the _thesis.tex_ to the root-directory and update paths to the other files. This issue is caused by a [limitation in Overleaf](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/531738/minted-environment-not-working-in-overleaf/531782#531782).
